## Build Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
1. (Optional) Protect your table surface by laying down cardboard or another protective material.
2. Organize tools and materials for easy access.

### Step 2: Cutting the Corrugated Plastic Sheets
1. Label and outline measurements on the corrugated plastic sheet using a white marker before cutting.
2. Carefully cut along the marked lines using a utility knife. Ensure clean edges.
3. (Optional) Adjust measurements to suit your desired track layout, keeping them proportional to the OpenBotâ€™s body size.

### Step 3: Creating Connecting Parts
#### Male Connector
1. Measure 9 cm and draw a 16.5 cm line.

2. Mark a line 2 cm from one side of the sheet.
3. Mark a 4 cm line downward from the marked edge.

4. Connect the ends to form a trapezium shape and repeat on both sides.

#### Female Connector
1. Mark a line 2 cm from one side of the sheet.
2. Mark a 4 cm line upwards from the line.
3. Connect the marked points to form a trapezium shape.

### Step 4: Carving the White Line
1. Use a box cutter to carefully cut along the marked lines.
2. Use a ruler as a guide for precision and straight cuts.
3. Use one straight track as a template for cutting additional tracks.
4. Ensure that each track connects properly before proceeding to the next one.

### Step 5: Curve Track
1. Mark the curve track lines on the short side of the corrugated plastic sheet.

3. Mark 7 cm from the male/female connector.
