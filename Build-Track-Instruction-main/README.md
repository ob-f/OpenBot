## Build Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
1. (Optional) Protect your table surface by laying down cardboard or another protective material.
2. Organize tools and materials for easy access.

### Step 2: Cutting the Corrugated Plastic Sheets
1. Label and outline measurements on the corrugated plastic sheet using a white marker before cutting.
2. Carefully cut along the marked lines using a utility knife. Ensure clean edges.
3. (Optional) Adjust measurements to suit your desired track layout, keeping them proportional to the OpenBotâ€™s body size.

### Step 3: Creating Connecting Parts
#### Male Connector
1. Measure 9 cm and draw a 16.5 cm line.

2. Mark a line 2 cm from one side of the sheet.
3. Mark a 4 cm line downward from the marked edge.

4. Connect the ends to form a trapezium shape and repeat on both sides.

#### Female Connector
1. Mark a line 2 cm from one side of the sheet.
2. Mark a 4 cm line upwards from the line.
3. Connect the marked points to form a trapezium shape.

### Step 4: Carving the White Line
1. Use a box cutter to carefully cut along the marked lines.
2. Use a ruler as a guide for precision and straight cuts.
3. Use one straight track as a template for cutting additional tracks.
4. Ensure that each track connects properly before proceeding to the next one.

### Step 5: Curve Track
1. Mark the curve track lines on the short side of the corrugated plastic sheet.

2. Repeat the marking on the opposite side.

3. Carefully cut along the marked lines, similar to the straight tracks.
4. Ensure that the final piece matches the reference image.

### Step 6: Marking and Decorating the Track
#### Straight Track
1. Apply tape along both edges, ensuring straight alignment.

3. Mark 7 cm from the male/female connector.
